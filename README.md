# Tropical-cyclone-stochastic-representation
This project is on effects of different stochastic representation on Tropical cyclone.

MSD_errorgrowth_apr12.m file shows the error growth curve vs time for different stochastic representation such as, Random forcing, random parametric condition and random initial condition. 

STDparacd2.m is for calculating standard deviation in the presence of Random parametric noise when added to parameter cd throughout the time evolution and STD vs noise amplitude is plotted. 95% Confidence Interval is added with the mean STD

Using the matlab codes the numerical analysis in the paper https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0062119 has been done.
